               efficiency and high-volume data, and so on. Based on the open
               data set of credit card in Taiwan, five data mining methods,
               Logistic regression, SVM, neural network, Xgboost and LightGBM,
               are compared in this paper. The results show that the AUC,
               F1-Score and the predictive correct ratio of LightGBM are the
               best, and that of Xgboost is second. It indicates that LightGBM
               or Xgboost has a good performance in the prediction of
               categorical response variables and has a good application value
               in the big data era.",

abstract = {This research aimed at the case of customers’ default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel “Sorting Smoothing Method” to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y=A+BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.}

abstract = {This paper evaluates the performance of a number of modelling approaches for future mortgage default status. Boosted regression trees, random forests, penalised linear and semi-parametric logistic regression models are applied to four portfolios of over 300,000 Irish owner-occupier mortgages. The main findings are that the selected approaches have varying degrees of predictive power and that boosted regression trees significantly outperform logistic regression. This suggests that boosted regression trees can be a useful addition to the current toolkit for mortgage credit risk assessment by banks and regulators.}

        abstract = {Despite recent improvements in machine-learning prediction methods, the methods used by most lenders to predict credit defaults have not changed. This is because most of the high-performing methods are of a black-box nature. It is a requirement that credit default prediction models be explainable. This research creates credit default prediction models using tree-based ensemble methods. It is shown that model performance can be improved by using gradient boosting methods over traditional credit default predictions models. The top performing XGBoost model is then taken and made explainable. This research proposes a model-agnostic counterfactual extraction algorithm that explains the drivers behind a particular prediction. The algorithm focuses on extracting the counterfactuals that have the fewest contrasting features. This results in counterfactuals that are easily understood by humans and can be easily translated into insights that the lay user can understand. A definite standard of explainability is defined and the counterfactual extraction algorithm results in explanations that meet this standard. Given that the explanation method is model agnostic, it can be used on any prediction model and can be deployed for a wide range of applications.}
