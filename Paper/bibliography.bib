               best, and that of Xgboost is second. It indicates that LightGBM

abstract = {This research aimed at the case of customers’ default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel “Sorting Smoothing Method” to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y=A+BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.}

abstract = {This paper evaluates the performance of a number of modelling approaches for future mortgage default status. Boosted regression trees, random forests, penalised linear and semi-parametric logistic regression models are applied to four portfolios of over 300,000 Irish owner-occupier mortgages. The main findings are that the selected approaches have varying degrees of predictive power and that boosted regression trees significantly outperform logistic regression. This suggests that boosted regression trees can be a useful addition to the current toolkit for mortgage credit risk assessment by banks and regulators.}

        abstract = {Despite recent improvements in machine-learning prediction methods, the methods used by most lenders to predict credit defaults have not changed. This is because most of the high-performing methods are of a black-box nature. It is a requirement that credit default prediction models be explainable. This research creates credit default prediction models using tree-based ensemble methods. It is shown that model performance can be improved by using gradient boosting methods over traditional credit default predictions models. The top performing XGBoost model is then taken and made explainable. This research proposes a model-agnostic counterfactual extraction algorithm that explains the drivers behind a particular prediction. The algorithm focuses on extracting the counterfactuals that have the fewest contrasting features. This results in counterfactuals that are easily understood by humans and can be easily translated into insights that the lay user can understand. A definite standard of explainability is defined and the counterfactual extraction algorithm results in explanations that meet this standard. Given that the explanation method is model agnostic, it can be used on any prediction model and can be deployed for a wide range of applications.}

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund &amp; R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.},
