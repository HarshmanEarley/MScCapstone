## Context of Results

Compare to previous studies

While being evaluated on slightly different metrics, the results of this study share a similar outcome with the original study on the Taiwan Credit Card default data, \citet{YEH20092473}. That paper found the Neural Network to be the optimal classifier out of a range which included logistic regression and single classifier trees. 

In a follow-on paper, \citet{Neema2017TheCO} , the Random Forest classifier performed better in a comparison which evaluated models based on a cost control perspective, assigning a higher cost to defaulters classified not correctly.

A significant takeaway from the results is the closeness in results between a relatively basic logistic regression model and the more advanced and intensive Neural Networks and Random Forest models. Accuracy was only improved by 0.02. A more substantial improvement of 0.08, was made in Sensitivity which is a more important statistic for financial institutions looking to predict credit card default in its customers.   
Arguably, a more interesting revelation is the closeness in results between the simple logistic regression model, utilising only one variable and the full regression model which had an extra 128 predictor variables. Of the five metrics recorded - Accuracy, AMEX Metric, AUC, Sensitivity and Specificity - the maximum improvement gained from the additional variables is 0.06, with the AMEX metric only improving by 0.03. As the feature labels are masked the description and function of this variable are unknown but it is clear of its importance to predicting credit card default.

More advanced forms of Neural Networks have also been applied to the problem, \citet{8682212} proposed using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) feature extractor with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) on credit card payment history to leverage the time dependencies embedded in these dynamic features of historical credit card data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are specifically designed to use recursive architecture to extract patterns from input sequences \citep{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. They have been proven helpful in applications that heavily rely on time-variant features. As a result, it is natural to consider RNN models as feature extractors for customer behaviour that often appear as sequences in financial data.

One of the main obstacles for contextualising the results is the lack of information of the variables included as part of the data. The only detail of the features was the category to which it belonged.[^varstab] Due to this, little inference can be made on the variables and the main outcome of this study is the performance of the models. Particularly it would be difficult to comment on the Delinquency and Risk variables as there is no further information to what they constitute and is impossible to infer any further information from them.  

The choice of models employed for this project was relatively arbitrary. A selection of three well known models which were seen to perform this task in previous studies using the Taiwan data were chosen. One simple method, one ensemble learning and one deep learning model were comparatively evaluated. This unfortunately does not allow us to benchmark the performance against internal models used by AMEX or other banks. This benchmark would allow analysis on whether any of the models employed in this study could provide value and risk mitigation. A small sample of potential models were used in this project. Models used in studies on other data that may improve performance independently or in tandem to other models. include K-Nearest Neighbour,Linear Discriminant Analysis,Logistic Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM.  


Other methods of evaluating and comparing the models could be employed in future. \citet{Neema2017TheCO} used a cost function when comparing methods to predict customers credit card default. A higher penalty or cost was given to defaulters classified incorrectly. A range of cost factors were used to identify a model with the best accuracy in predicting a defaulter in a cost- effective manner.
