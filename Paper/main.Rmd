Research into utilising ML methods to predict credit card default has largely been limited to one historic data set. As part of an applied data science competition organised by the American Express credit card company, an industrial-sized dataset was released which in turn provided the foundation to further research in this field. A subset of the data was used and feature engineered to create a dataset of 458'913 individual customer observations and 129 features, with masked feature labels. Exploratory data analysis found the P_2 variable, in particular, displayed a strong positive correlation with the target variable - defaulting on credit card payment. Four ML classification models were trained, validated and tested on independent data to predict the target - logistic regression, logistic regression (P_2 variable only), Random Forrest and Artificial Neural Networks.
