# :blue_book: Overview

The aim of this project is to apply a range of machine learning techniques to predict credit card default using the historical data of credit card customers. The following report describes the process undertaken to compare a number of models. Beginning with an industrial size dataset, cleansing and formatting the data before using it to train, tune and evaluate the chosen models based on the historical data of credit card customers.
