# Adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/code/inversion/amex-competition-metric-python

#The evaluation metric, 𝑀, for this competition is the mean of two measures of rank ordering: Normalized Gini Coefficient, 𝐺, and default rate captured at 4%, 𝐷.
#𝑀=0.5⋅(𝐺+𝐷)
#The default rate captured at 4% is the percentage of the positive labels (defaults) captured within the highest-ranked 4% of the predictions, and represents a Sensitivity/Recall statistic.
#For both of the sub-metrics 𝐺 and 𝐷, the negative labels are given a weight of 20 to adjust for downsampling.
#This metric has a maximum value of 1.0.
